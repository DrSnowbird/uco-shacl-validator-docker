   # ENGAGE Objectives

objective:Affect a objective:Objective ;
    uco-core:name "Affect"@en ;
    uco-core:description "An Affect objective is defined by MITRE ENGAGE EGO0002 (Affect) and involves the capability to negatively impact an adversary's operations. Affect is ultimately about changing the cost-value proposition in cyber operations for the adversary. The defender may want to increase the adversary’s cost to operate or drive down the value they derive from their operations. For example, the defender can negatively impact the adversary’s on-network operations to drive up the resource cost of doing operations by slowing down or selectively resetting connections to impact exfiltration. This type of activity increases the adversary’s time on target and wastes their resources. To drive down the value of stolen data, a defender could provide an adversary deliberately conflicting information. Providing such information requires an adversary to either choose to believe one piece of data over another, disregard both, collect more data, or continue with uncertainty."@en ;

objective:Detect a objective:Objective ;
    uco-core:name "Detect"@en ;
    uco-core:description "A Detect objective is defined by MITRE ENGAGE EAP0002 (Detect) and involves the capability to establish or maintain awareness regarding adversary activity. Detection activities focus on the defender’s ability to monitor adversary activity throughout an environment, often by creating high-fidelity detections. These detections can be produced in several ways. For example, a defender can deploy lures as tripwires in the environment. The defender may create custom alerts based on TTPs or IOCs observed during a malware detonation operation. Finally, the defender may write customer decoders to analyze and alert on malicious traffic. In all these cases, detection activities allow the defender to produce a high-fidelity alert to monitor adversary activities. Often Detection activities are also good cybersecurity practices. However, in Engage, these activities will focus exclusively on the intersection of denial, deception, and adversary engagement technologies and the defender’s ability to Expose the adversary."@en ;
	.
 

objective:Direct a objective:Objective ;
    uco-core:name "Direct"@en ;
    uco-core:description "A Direct objective is defined by MITRE ENGAGE EAP0004 (Direct) and involves the capability to encourage or discourage an adversary from conducting their operation as intended. Direction activities focus on moving the adversary towards or away from an intended path. This forced direction can be accomplished by removing or disabling some resources, while adding or enabling others. The defender can add lures or otherwise manipulate the environment to attempt to elicit specific responses from the adversary. Additionally, the defender can tighten some security controls while leaving others overly permissive or weakened. Finally, the defender can physically move the adversary by moving threats from their intended environment and into a safe engagement environment. For example, a suspicious email attachment can be moved from the intended target to an engagement environment for analysis. No matter how the direction is achieved, the defender hopes to force the adversary to take unintended actions or stop intended actions."@en ;

objective:Disrupt a objective:Objective ;
    uco-core:name "Disrupt"@en ;
    uco-core:description "A Disrupt objective is defined by MITRE ENGAGE EAP0005 (Disrupt) and involves the capability to impair an adversary’s ability to conduct their operation as intended. Disruption activities are used to stop or discourage an adversary from conducting part or all of their mission. This disruption may increase the time, skills, or resources needed for the adversary to accomplish a specific task. For example, a defender may degrade network speeds as the adversary attempts to exfiltrate large blocks of data. As a second example, the defender may manipulate the output of commonly used discovery commands to show targets that do not exist or to hide real targets. In either case, the adversary may waste resources acting on partial or falsified data. Disruptions may also include planting misinformation designed to influence the adversary’s decision-makers to make the wrong decisions or to waste resources."@en ;

objective:Elicit a objective:Objective ;
    uco-core:name "Elicit"@en ;
    uco-core:description "An Elicit objective is defined by MITRE ENGAGE EGO0003 (Elicit) and involves the capability to learn about an adversary's tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs). Elicit encourages adversaries to reveal additional or more advanced TTPs and goals while operating in defender-controlled engagement environments. These high-fidelity, synthetic engagement environments are uniquely tailored to engage with specific adversaries. They may contain a combination of documents, browser artifacts, etc. to reassure an adversary and reduce suspicion. Further, they may offer enticing data and exploitable vulnerabilities to motivate an adversary to operate in the defender’s environment. These environments can either be left as a dangle, i.e., honeypot. Other times, the defender may self-infect with malware. In either case, observing an adversary as they operate can provide organizations with actionable cyber threat intelligence and potential understanding of the adversary’s goals."@en ;
	.
 

objective:Expose a objective:Objective ;
    uco-core:name "Expose"@en ;
    uco-core:description "An Expose objective is defined by MITRE ENGAGE EGO0001 (Expose) and involves the capability to reveal the presence of ongoing adversary operations. Expose is about discovering previously undetected adversaries engaging in one of two behaviors. First, the adversary may be attempting to gain access to the networks. Second, the adversary may be currently operating on the networks. Both categories of adversary behavior contain vulnerabilities that can be advantageous for a defender seeking to expose the adversary. As an example of such a vulnerability, when an adversary interacts with network or system resources, they are vulnerable to trigger tripwires. The defender can make and leak fake credentials both inside and outside of the network. The defender can then monitor for the use of these credentials. Then, when an adversary uses a fake credential, the defender will receive a high-fidelity alert. In addition, if the credentials are unique, a defender may be able to detect how and when an adversary collected the credentials. Whenever a defender seeks to engage with an adversary, operational safety is paramount. To maintain this safety, it is a best practice to monitor adversaries as they operate in an engagement environment. Additionally, the defender must be able to observe the adversary. Therefore, collection and detection activities can often be utilized even when a defender may have other strategic goals in mind."@en ;

objective:Motivate a objective:Objective ;
    uco-core:name "Motivate"@en ;
    uco-core:description "A Motivate objective is defined by MITRE ENGAGE EAP0007 (Motivate) and involves the capability to encourage an adversary to conduct part or all of their mission. Motivating activities is used to encourage an adversary to conduct part or all of their mission by providing a target-rich environment. To do this, the defender can use unpatched versions of operating systems and software, remove end-point detection software, and use weak passwords. Additionally, the defender can open firewall ports, add proxy capabilities, or introduce elements that an adversary can easily leverage to bypass an obstacle in their operations. Finally, the defender can include enticing data to the environment to encourage the adversary to steal the data."@en ;
	.

 

objective:Plan a objective:Objective ;
    uco-core:name "Plan"@en ;
    uco-core:description "A Plan objective is defined by MITRE ENGAGE SAP0001 (Plan) and involves the capability to identify and align an operation with a desired end-state. Planning is used to identify and align an operation within the context of strategic goals. By helping the defender to first identify their goals, Planning ensures that all engagement activities are focused and driving forward progress. Additionally, planning ensures that the defender can integrate the inputs of the various stakeholders at the beginning of an operation to ensure that the operation is efficient, effective, and safe. Finally, Planning activities ensure that each operation is informed by the successes and learns from the failures of past operations."@en ;
	.
 

objective:Prepare a objective:Objective ;
    uco-core:name "Prepare"@en ;
    uco-core:description "A Prepare objective is defined by MITRE ENGAGE SGO0001 (Prepare) and involves the capability to help a defender think about what they want to accomplish with operations. Prepare is used to ensure the defender drives progress during adversary engagement operations towards a desired end-state or Strategic Goal. To support this aim, the defender must first generate a clear picture of their organization and the threat landscape. This understanding should include their current security posture, including known strengths and weaknesses, and an inventory of priority cyber assets, including key intellectual property. The defender should then examine and update the threat models for any identified adversaries. These various assessments and models should enable the defender to identify their strategic goal. At this point, all activities should be aligned with this goal. Once a goal has been selected, the defender must work to plan for the operation by identifying a target adversary, creating the necessary Personas, generating an operational storyboard, etc. Finally, the key stakeholders should be called on to establish rules for operational safety and acceptable risk. At each step in the planning process, the defender should incorporate intelligence gained from previous operations to ensure that future operations can run more effectively and efficiently. Engage seeks to highlight that denial, deception, and adversary engagement activities cannot be viewed as `fire and forget`. Unlike many defensive technologies, these activities must be viewed only in context of how they inform and drive progress towards larger strategic goals. To this end, Prepare is essential to ensure that every action taken in an engagement operation drives progress towards a unified goal."@en ;

objective:Prevent a objective:Objective ;
    uco-core:name "Prevent"@en ;
    uco-core:description "A Prevent objective is defined by MITRE ENGAGE EAP0003 (Prevent) and involves the capability to stop all or part of an adversary’s ability to conduct their operation as intended. Prevention activities focus on stopping the adversary’s ability to conduct their operations as intended. The defender can physically or virtually remove or disable resources, tighten security controls, or otherwise impair the adversary’s ability to operate. A defender might prevent an adversary from operating to force them to reveal different, possibly more advanced, capabilities. Additionally, a defender can use prevention activities to discourage the adversary from operating against a specific target. In this case, the defender may be attempting to encourage the adversary to focus elsewhere in the engagement environment. There are many more prevention activities that are also good cybersecurity practices. However, in Engage, we are focused on a subset of activities. Those are focused exclusively on the intersection of denial, deception, and adversary engagement technologies and the defender’s ability to Affect the adversary."@en ;

objective:Reassure a objective:Objective ;
    uco-core:name "Reassure"@en ;
    uco-core:description "A Reassure objective is defined by MITRE ENGAGE EAP0006 (Reassure) and involves the capability to add authenticity to deceptive components to convince an adversary that an environment is real. Reassurance activities are used to add authenticity to deceptive components to reduce adversary suspicion about the legitimacy of the environment. Activities include adding realistic user accounts, files, system activity, and any other content that an adversary might expect to find on the system. These activities may add new artifacts, such as peripherals and pocket litter, while concealing others, such as how recently an environment was stood up. If done correctly, reassuring an adversary may help to make them feel more comfortable upon landing in a new environment. This initial level of comfort can help anchor the adversary in the environment, increasing their tolerance to faults or weaknesses discovered later."@en ;

Analysis is used to aggregate, examine, and evaluate the results of an operation. Analysis is useful for improving the defender’s security posture through the synthesis of operational data. Additionally, analysis can be used to turn data into actionable intelligence about an adversary’s motivators, behaviors, tactics, and techniques. Defenders can use analysis to gain insight into adversary activity and thus inform detection and analytics refinements. Reviewing the execution of an operation also provides feedback for the team to improve the quality of future operations. Finally, Analysis activities ensure that each operation is informed by the successes and learns from the failures of past operations."@en ;
